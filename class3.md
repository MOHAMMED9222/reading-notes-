## Versian Control
-Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes.

### Local Version Control
-A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

### Centralized Version Control
-This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.

### Distributed Version Control
-A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure.

## What is a Git
-Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
