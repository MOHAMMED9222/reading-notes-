## Readings: MongoDB and Mongoose

**SQL databases** are good for structured data with predefined schema, such as financial data, inventory data, or employee records. A real-world example is a bank using an SQL database to store customer information, account balances, and transactions.

**NoSQL databases** are good for unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media posts, sensor data, or log files. A real-world example is a company using a NoSQL database to store user profiles, preferences, and behavior data for a mobile app.

A **hierarchical data storage** structure is best suited for a NoSQL database. This is because NoSQL databases can handle different types of data structures, including nested data structures, which can be useful for hierarchical data.

NoSQL databases are generally considered better for scalability because they are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and can scale horizontally across multiple servers.

**SQL** stands for Structured Query Language.

A **relational database** is a type of database that stores data in tables with predefined relationships between them. It is based on the relational data model, which defines the structure of the database and the relationships between tables.

A **relational database** works with a table-based structure. Each table represents a specific entity or object, and each row in the table represents a specific instance of that entity or object. The columns in the table represent the attributes or properties of the entity or object.

A **schema** is a blueprint or plan that defines the structure and organization of a database. It specifies the tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints for the database.

A NoSQL database is a type of database that is not based on the relational data model. Instead, it uses a variety of data models, such as document-based, key-value, or graph-based models, to store and manage data. NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and can scale horizontally across multiple servers.

A **MongoDB database** contains collections of documents, which are stored in BSON format (a binary representation of JSON). Each document can have a different structure, and documents in the same collection do not need to have the same fields or data types.

MongoDB is generally considered more flexible than SQL because it can handle unstructured or semi-structured data and can easily adapt to changes in data structure or schema. SQL databases are more rigid in terms of their schema and require predefined relationships between tables.

One disadvantage of a NoSQL database is that it may not support ACID transactions, which ensure data consistency and integrity in multi-step operations. NoSQL databases may also have limited query capabilities compared to SQL databases, depending on the data model used.
