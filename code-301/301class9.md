## FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

**PURE FUNCTION**
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

When data is **immutable**, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

**Referential transparency** is a fancy term that is attached to a computable expression. A piece of code is referentially transparent if we can safely replace that piece of code with the value it computes and vice-versa, anywhere where that piece is used, without changing the meaning or result of our program.

**Modules**
JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.

This makes it easier to maintain a code-base.

Modules are imported from external files with the import statement.

Modules also rely on type="module" in the <script> tag.

**require()** statement basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object. require() statement not only allows to add built-in core NodeJS modules but also community-based and local modules.
