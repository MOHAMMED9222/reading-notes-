## CLASS 07 NOTES

**Roy T. Fielding**, Senior Principal Scientist at Adobe, is known for his pioneering work on the World Wide Web, open source, and software architecture.

Most technique developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didnt have the techniques we use. We just had to talk to small group of machines.

**HTTP**—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

**GET** is used to request data from a specified resource.

**POST** is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 

**PUT** is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

In computing, the **PATCH** method is a request method in HTTP for making partial changes to an existing resource.
