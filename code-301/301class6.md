## NODE.JS

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses 

Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.The **V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and 
Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can 
execute.

Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript **runtime**.

**npm** stands for Node Package Manager. It's a library and registry for JavaScript software packages.

Node can be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional 
applications.
