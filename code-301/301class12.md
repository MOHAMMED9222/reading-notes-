## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

100's: These status codes are informational and indicate that the request has been received and understood, and that the client should continue with the request.

200's: These status codes indicate that the request has been successfully received, understood, and processed by the server.

300's: These status codes indicate that the requested resource has moved or changed locations, and the client should take additional actions to complete the request.

400's: These status codes indicate that there was an error in the client's request, and the server could not complete the request due to the client's fault.

500's: These status codes indicate that there was an error in the server's attempt to fulfill the client's request.

A **status code of 202** indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed yet. The server may return more information about the status of the request in the future.

A **status code of 308** is a permanent redirect status code, indicating that the resource requested has been permanently moved to a new location.

If an update didn't return data to a client, you would use the **204 status code**, indicating that the server has successfully processed the request, but there is no data to return to the client.

If a resource used to exist but no longer does, you would use the **410 status code**, indicating that the requested resource is gone and will not be coming back.

The **'Forbidden' status code, 403**, indicates that the server understood the request, but refuses to authorize access to the requested resource. This status code is typically used when the client does not have sufficient permissions to access the resource.

We need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env file because the database string often contains sensitive information, such as the username and password required to access the database. By storing this information in the .env file, we can ensure that it is not exposed to others who may have access to the server code.

**Middleware** is software that sits between an application's backend and frontend, and acts as a bridge between the two. It can perform various tasks such as logging, authentication, and data validation. Middleware can be used to modify the request and response objects, add or remove headers, and execute additional code before or after the request is processed.

**app.use(express.json())** is middleware for handling incoming JSON data. It is used to parse incoming request bodies in JSON format, and populate the request object with the parsed JSON data.

The **/:id** in a route is a parameter that allows us to capture a dynamic value from the URL. It allows us to handle requests for resources with different IDs or values in a dynamic way. For example, a route defined as /users/:id would match requests for URLs like /users/1, /users/2, and so on.

**PUT and PATCH** are both HTTP methods used for updating resources on the server. The key difference between them is in how they handle partial updates. PUT is used for replacing an entire resource or creating a new resource if it doesn't exist, while PATCH is used for making partial updates to an existing resource.

In a **schema**, you can set default values for fields by using the 'default' key. For example, if you have a 'user' schema with a 'role' field, you can set the default value for 'role' to 'user' like this:

const userSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  role: { type: String, default: 'user' }
});

A **500 error** status code indicates that there was an internal server error, and the server was unable to fulfill the request due to an unexpected condition. This error is typically caused by a problem on the server-side code, rather than an issue with the client's request.

A **status code of 200** indicates that the server has successfully processed the request and is returning the requested resource. A status code of 201, on the other hand, indicates that the server has successfully created a new resource as a result of the request.
