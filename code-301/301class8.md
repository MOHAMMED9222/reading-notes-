## REST

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

REST APIs are designed around a application programming interface

The Identifier is a unique string that identifies a resource.

The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. 

A URI must represent an object, uniquely and permanently

Reason why chatty APIs are considered poor quality is because requiring multiple network calls will slow down an application. This is because each call contains data overhead (i.e. sender information, headers, authentication) which will slow down an application as well as network latency per each request.
