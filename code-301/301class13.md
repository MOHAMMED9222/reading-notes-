# CRUD
## BASICS

he **HTTP method** typically used to update a record through an API is the PUT method.

The **PUT method** is used to completely replace the existing resource with the updated content. It requires the client to send the entire resource representation in the request body, including any unchanged properties.

In contrast, the PATCH method is used to make a partial update to a resource, meaning that only the specified properties in the request body will be updated, leaving the rest of the resource unchanged.

Therefore, if you need to update a record by replacing its entire content with new data, you should use the PUT method. If you only need to update specific properties of the record, then you should use the PATCH method.

In a **RESTful API**, the HTTP methods that typically require an ID parameter are GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

**GET** is used to retrieve a resource, so it requires the ID of the specific resource to be retrieved.
**PUT** is used to completely replace a resource, so it also requires the ID of the specific resource to be updated.
**PATCH** is used to make a partial update to a resource, and like PUT, it requires the ID of the resource being updated.
**DELETE** is used to delete a resource, so it requires the ID of the specific resource to be deleted.

## VIDEOS

**CRUD** is a set of basic data manipulation operations that can be performed on a resource, while **REST** is an architectural style that defines how those operations can be exposed through an API.

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
Identify the resources
Define the data model
Implement the API endpoints
Implement authentication and authorization
Test and document the API
