*[Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)

-A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site

-A great feature of any text editing software is code completion

-Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed

## Things I want to know more about, 
-Are there subsription based text editors?
