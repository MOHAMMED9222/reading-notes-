# Class 6 Notes

**CONTROL FLOW**

-The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

-To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

**FUNCTION**

-A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

-A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

-A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

-Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

**Operators**

-The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

-let x = 10;
