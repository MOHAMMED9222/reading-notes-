# Class 8 Notes

**Comparison Operators**

-A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. 

-*Strings* are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values.

- The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons.

**Assignment Operators**

-An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

-The simple assignment operator is equal ( = ), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f( ) is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f( ) to x.

# Loops

**for statement**

-A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.
  
**While statement**

-A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

-while (condition)
  statement
