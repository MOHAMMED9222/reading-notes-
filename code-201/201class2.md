# HTML

*Semantics* are relied on everywhere around usâ€”we rely on previous experience to tell us what the function of an everyday object is; when we see something, we know what its function will be. 

*HTML* defines **six** levels of headings.

The **sup** element represents a *superscript* and the **sub** element represents a *subscript*.

The **title** attribute may be used to provide an expansion of the abbreviation. The attribute, if specified, must contain an expansion of the 

abbreviation, and nothing else.

# CSS

*INLINE* is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Inline CSS also mixes ( CSS ) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and contentmakes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.

# JSS

**Strings** are objects are classified into different classes, or data types: 4 is an integer, and "Hello, World!" is a string, so-called because it contains a string or sequence of letters

## Javascript Operators

- Assignment Operators.
- Comparison Operators.

# CODE

conditional logic --> if/else if/else
if (condition is true){
code to execute;
}else is(this condtion is true){
code to execute;
} 
else{
code to execute;
}

The < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal), and >= (greater than or equal) comparison, also known as relational, operators compare their operands.
