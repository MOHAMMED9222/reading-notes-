# HYPERLINK
A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an **< a >** element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
For < a > and < area > elements, the href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. For < base > elements, the href attribute specifies the base URL for all relative URLs on a page. For < link > elements, the href attribute specifies the location ( URL ) of the external resource ( most often a style sheet file ).
## Accessibility
- Create Accessible Hypertext Links
- Use concise and meaningful text for links.
- Do not capitalize all letters in links.
- Avoid using URLs for link text.
- Do not use the word "link" as part of the link text.
- Do not use tooltips/screentips to add additional information.
## CSS Layout
**Normal Flow, or Flow Layout**, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.
**Block elements** always start from a new line. **Inline elements** never start from a new line. **Block elements** cover space from left to right as far as it can go. **Inline elements** only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element
**STATIC** positioning is the default for every html element.
**Benefits of using absolutely positioned elements**
- Aside from a few IE bugs, very good cross-browser support.
- Less dependence on floats, which can be problematic.
- Less dependence on margins, which can be a bit buggy in older IE.
**Absolutely positioned** elements are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block. Elements with **fixed positioning** are fixed with respect to the viewportâ€”the viewport is always their containing block.
## FUNCTIONS
A **function declaration** tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A **function** definition provides the actual body of the function.
The *values* that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.
