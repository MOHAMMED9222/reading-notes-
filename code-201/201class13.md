**LOCAL STORAGE**

- Local storage provides at least 5MB of data storage across all major web browsers, which is a heck of a lot more than the 4KB (maximum size) that you can 

  store in a cookie. This makes local storage particularly useful if you want to cache some application data in the browser for later usage.

- Given the potential vectors where malicious actors can access information on your browser's local storage, it is easy to see why sensitive information such 

  as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), authentication tokens, user locations and API keys, etc., should never be stored in the local storage.
  
-  Literally, localStorage can store only strings. Even if you need to store an integer you need to convert it into a string and have to store it.

  The different dataTypes supported by JS are:

  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Null
  - Object
  - Array
  - Custom data types
