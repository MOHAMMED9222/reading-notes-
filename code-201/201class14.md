**Psychologically Safe Teams**

Key Factors

-Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.
-Acknowledge your own fallibility.
-Model curiosity and ask lots of questions.

I have never experienced psychological safety in the work place, but i have seen the pressure that higher rank people can have on younger veterans who just entered the military and try to intimidate them. It belittles people and doesnt let them have the confidence and unlock their true potential 

What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? Team moral is usually higher resulting in a chemistry thatll make workflow and communication easy.
