*Reading Notes*

# DOMAIN MODELING

**Domain modeling** is a great tool for Agile enterprise to carry out a common language and a fundamental structure important for the analysis of features and epics. The domain model is defined and continuously refactored as enterprise knowledge about the domain improves and the system functionality evolves.

# HTML BASICS

**REASONS NOT FOR TABLES**

- **Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users**: screen readers, used by blind people, interpret the tags that exist in an HTML page and read out the contents to the user. Because tables are not the right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screen readers' output will be confusing to their users.

- **Tables produce tag soup**: As mentioned above, table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.

- **Tables are not automatically responsive**: When you use proper layout containers (such as < header > , < section > , < a rticle > , or < div > ), their width defaults to 100 % of their parent element. Tables on the other hand are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.

**SEMANTIC TAGS**

- < header > : The header tag defines content that should be considered the introductory information of a page or section.
  
- < nav > : The navigation tag is used for navigation links. ...
  
- < main > : This tag contains the main content (also called the body) of a page.

**CONSTRUCTOR**

A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:

- create a new object

- bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code

- run the code in the constructor

- return the new object.

**PROTOTYPES**

My understanding of prototypes is having a veteran qb on the bench who knows all the reads to the playbook but got benched becuase he lost the locker room. Now you have a new draft at qb but in order for him to learn the reads the veteran qb has to pass it through him in practice(function).

## THINGS I WANT TO KNOW

not sure if i make sense about prototypes
